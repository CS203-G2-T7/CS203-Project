# OurGardenStory

Greenhouse gases (GHG) like Carbon Dioxide are produced at every stage of food production 
– during transportation, packaging, and disposal. Singapore relies heavily on other countries 
for food. This, coupled with the food waste generated by Singaporeans consequently increase 
Singapore's GHG emissions significantly. 

To reduce our carbon emissions by reducing reliance on imports, the Singapore Food Agency 
rolled out the “Singapore 30 by 30” plan to encourage Singaporeans to grow their own produce 
at home or in an allotment garden. However, having interviewed the Deputy Director of NParks, 
we learnt that the current balloting system for allotment gardens is inefficient. Consequently, 
fewer people are enticed to grow their own produce, impeding efforts toward increased local 
food production and ultimately our climate change goals.

## Our Solution

Our web application, OurGardenStory, aims to provide users with a comprehensive solution 
to ballot for allotment gardens and manage their plants. This helps Singaporeans grow more 
food and play a part in combating climate change.

## Why is it needed?

The process of balloting and onboarding of the allotment garden program is slow for NParks, 
and not transparent for the bidders. Bidders have voiced their concerns about the fairness 
of the balloting process as living in close proximity to allotment gardens does not entail 
a higher chance of success. NParks have also mentioned that their management of applicants 
and their information is manual and inefficient.

We can solve these issues through our solution, by automating the bidding process,  
facilitating payment and communication between NParks and the allotment gardeners. Our 
bidding algorithm will take into account the geolocation of allotment gardens in relation 
to the residential address of applicants. Also, educating people through OurGardenStory will 
build a greener community that promotes healthy gardening practices, especially for people 
that are inexperienced in gardening. Our solution will be impactful in helping Singapore be 
more self-reliant on food production and reduce GHG emissions.
