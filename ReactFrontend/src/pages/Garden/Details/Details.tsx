            What is allotment garden?
            <p>
              Allotment gardens are areas located within parks and gardens that house gardening plots available for lease to the community to grow their own plants. With most of the population living in high-rise flats with minimal space for gardening within their household footprint, these allotment garden plots provide them with further opportunities to garden. To date, more than 2000 allotment garden plots have been made available to the community with plans for further expansion. In tandem, NParks is working with Town Councils and Grassroot Organisations to provide advice on setting up of allotment gardens in public housing estates so that residents can garden closer to their homes.

            What are the recommend plants to grow?
              <p>Here is a list of suggested edible plants you can grow:</p>
              <p>Bayam, Cai Xin, Kang Kong, Kailan, Kale, Lettuce, Okinawa Spinach, Sweet Potato, Ulam Raja, Brinjal, Chilli, Ladyâ€™s-Finger, Long Bean, Tomato, Basil, Cekur, Chives, Cincau, Indian Borage, Laska, Mint, Oyster Plant, Pandan, Saw Tooth Coriander, Tumeric</p>
              <p>All plants and gardening structures should not exceed 1 metre in standing height
                (measured from soil level in the planter bed). Gardeners are advised not to plant

                to the public. Plants that are illegal are not allowed to be planted.
                Please also be mindful of the neighbouring plots when planting up your mini garden and
                ensure that your plants do not encroach into their space. Keep your space clean and tidy
                for the safety of all your fellow allotment gardeners.
